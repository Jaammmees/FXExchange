# Real-Time FX Price Viewer (and Potentially Trader)

Project is a real-time FX price viewer that is currently using the OANDA API for fetching live FX Data.
Currently using python as there is more support for python but would want to try my luck with developing this in C++

## Key Functionalities
* Fetching Live FX Data: Utilizes OANDA's API to fetch live data for specified currency pairs and granularity (e.g., 5-minute intervals).

* Real-Time Candlestick Chart: Displays the FX data as a live-updating candlestick chart, showing open, high, low, and close prices.
